## Git Workflow

If you haven't already, read these two articles as we follow *Git workflow* elaborated in them  
* [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

In short, it is required to create new feature branches instead of directly commiting to `master` and submitting pull request against `master` which would be reviewed and merged after required/requested changes if any.
