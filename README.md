A Technology Blog built following JAMstack Architecure.

Now what is JAM Stack?

 |- J - Javascript -  Any dynamic programming is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. 
        This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript.
 |- A - API's - All server-side processes or database actions are done by APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript [See AJAX -                         https://medium.com/@TheJesseLewis/how-to-pull-data-from-json-apis-with-jquery-and-ajax-when-you-re-a-totes-noob-d6b6349cd21f].
              
              These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.
 |- M - Markup - Basically a template to start upon.

So JAM stack architecture essentially means we are letting API's do the heavy lifting shitty work[ Just kidding :p]

Now What is Gatsby?????

 No tension, lets see. 

   Gatsby is a static site generator.

      | - What the F*** is that?
           | - It serves the server HTML from Markdown or JSON etc.
               |- What is Markdown?
                  |- To customise your text you use three ways:- 
                      | - Editor WYSIWYG - What you see is what you get editors - Basically B button makes thongs Bold, 
                      | - HTML - <b>Bold Text</b>
                      | - Markdown - **Bold Text** - sort like whatsap or stack overflow

           | - Now Gatsby takes Markdown and gives to GRAPHQL which then gives the website to view - sorta like run time compiling. 
           | - It uses ReactJS and GraphQL!!!

     | - What is GraphQL?
           |- It is a Query Language that is used to talk to your API and give stuff to the client side;A bridge betwen client and server side.
        
| - Gatsby Flow vs CMS flow:
    |- Take any CMS say wordpress, what happens is:
       | - You create your site - Content of the site is saved in the database.
       | - Using PHP it pulls data from the databse and gives HTML code. 
    |- Gatsby - ReactJS and GraphQL
    |- It uses markdown, 
    |- GraphQL - Query Language.
